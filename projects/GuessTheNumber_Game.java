		 * i'll check user given number's first position with random number's first position and

		 * and i have used variable(check) to count, i.e if both the number are in same position and correct 
		 * then it'll increase its value by 1, and i have also counted the user given number in count_user array.
		 * so atlast if check is equal to range(random number's digit) then all numbers user given is correct, so it'll end there.
		 * if not, then it enter into else block where i given if the current index has character = 'c' then it will move to next number.
		 * Because i have already checked correct number with same position and i have the count of occurrence of user given number.
		 * now i have to check whether the number presents but with different position or not presents.
		 * for that i compare the user given number's occurrence that doesn't have character ='c' with the user given number's 
		 * occurrence in random number, if the user given number's occurrence count greater then the number not presents otherwise 
		 * the number presents but in different position.
		 * For e.g => random number = 1212 , user given number = 1111, after first logic (c, ,c, ) 1st and 3rd position and number are same 
		 * so it marked as 'c' and count of occurrence are added, count of occurrence of 1 (2).
		 * other's aren't same so it doen't marked, to check if the number presents in different position or not presents.
		 * so in 2nd logic 1st position and 3rd position number willn't enter 2nd number will enter and counts the occurrence of that number
		 * and after it compares now user number occurrence is (3) which is greater than random number's occurrence of 1 (2)
